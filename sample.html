                April 22nd, to encourage all Calvin students to "recycle" their old
                things so that other students can take them (for free!).                                </p>
        <p class="p4">We will be collecting items you wish to donate from Thursday, April
                18th until Monday, April 22nd; simply bring old clothing, books,
                pictures, and other accessories to the shopping cart that will be
                stationed in your dorm's main lobby.</p>
        <p class="p4">Then, please join us on Commons Lawn from 12:00-4:00 PM on the 22nd               to
                participate in the actual Freecycle event! There will be free cookies 
                and tables full of the donated items that ALL Calvin students, both 
                on-campus and off-campus, are free to take, regardless of whether or 
                not you personally donated any items. In case of rain, the Freecycle 
                will be held in the Hekman Library Lobby at the same scheduled time.</p>
        <p class="p4">If you have any questions about this exciting event, please ask                       your
                dorm's Sustainability Coordinator(s). Don't forget to donate items
                beginning this Friday or to attend the event on Monday, the 22nd!</p>

Subject: bicycle season is back!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">In the last couple of weeks, I am aware of two serious bicycle accidents. One involved a student who needed to have surgery on a badly broken leg, the other was my colleague and Director of Student Activities, Ken Heffner. Ken's accident resulted in broken ribs and a badly broken clavicle which will require surgery later this week (he had to postpone the surgery date as he had a little event last week called the Festival of Faith and Writing!). With the change of weather, those of us who bike will be taking to the streets in increasing number. Please be on the look-out. And two final urgings: please attend to stop signs and intersection protocol. I have heard of that often bicyclists on campus cruise through intersections without much attention to whether or not there are vehicles nearby; wear helmets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p4">We are planning a SURPRISE party for Patsy, who runs the snack <br>
shop in the De Vos Center lobby. Many of you, especially those who <br>
frequent the De Vos Center for one reason or another, know Patsy and <br>
know what a sweetheart she is. We are planning a surprise party for <br>
her on Tuesday, May 14 (which is during exam week) at 12:30. There <br>
will be cake in the De Vos Lobby for her, and we're hoping to decorate <br>
around her stand. <br>
In addition, we want to buy her a gift certificate to Schuler Books. <br>
If you would like to donate $1-5 for that, you can either contact <br>
Elisabeth Bomhof (emb25@students.calvin.edu) or put money in an <br>
envelope in Professor Goetz's office (DV 265). If anyone wants to help <br>
plan or decorate, please email Elisabeth about that as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
